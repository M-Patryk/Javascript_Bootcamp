//Nothing really special here. Just a few methods that i have to remember.
//Methods below "take" specific element and put it into variable if we define one
//One thing to remember is that the values have to be put as a strings

// document.getElementById('bear-photo') 
// document.getElementByTagName('ul')
// document.getElementByClassName('special')


//With variable
//const flipBear = document.getElementById('bear-photo)
