//Nothing really special here. Just a few methods that i have to remember.
//Methods below "take" specific element and put it into variable if we define one
//One thing to remember is that the values have to be put as a strings

// document.getElementById('bear-photo') 
// document.getElementByTagName('ul')
// document.getElementByClassName('special')

//It's good to note, that if i write document.getElementsById, it will get ALL elements (added "s" to "element")


//With variable
//const flipBear = document.getElementById('bear-photo)


//There is actually 4th method which "rules them all"
// --- querySelector && querySelectorAll
//The reason the "querySelectorAll" exists is because "querySelector" selects ONLY ONE element
